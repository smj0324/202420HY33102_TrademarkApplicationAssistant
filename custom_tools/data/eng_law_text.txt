### Article 8 (Indication of Quality in Trademarks)

1. **Indication of Origin**: Under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 3 (hereinafter referred to as "this Article"), the “indication of origin for the goods” refers to the region where the characteristics of the goods can be directly associated with specific geographical conditions such as climate or soil. This includes cases where the goods are either produced in that region historically or presently, or are widely recognized by consumers as being from that region. However, in cases where applications for certification marks of geographical indications are filed, even if such marks correspond to indications of origin, this Article does not apply. Also, for trademark applications for wines and distilled spirits indicating origin (with exceptions provided under Article 7, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 14), Article 7, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 14 applies.

2. **Indication of Quality**: The “indication of quality for the goods” under this Article refers to a direct indication of the state or excellence of quality of the goods in relation to the designated goods.

3. **Indication of Raw Material**: The “indication of raw material of the goods” under this Article pertains to raw materials (including major components) that are actually used or are recognized as being potentially usable in the designated goods.

4. **Indication of Efficacy**: The “indication of efficacy of the goods” under this Article refers to a direct indication of the performance or effect of the goods in relation to the designated goods.

5. **Indication of Usage**: The “indication of usage for the goods” under this Article refers to a direct indication of the use of the designated goods.

6. **Indication of Quantity**: The “indication of quantity of the goods” under this Article refers to the quantity and quantity units or symbols used in the transaction for the designated goods.

7. **Indication of Form**: The “indication of form of the goods or packaging” under this Article refers to a direct representation of the appearance, shape (including patterns), or specifications of the goods or packaging in relation to the designated goods. In particular, in the case of three-dimensional trademarks, if the shape of the goods or packaging is recognized as a common form, it falls under this Article.

8. **Indication of Price**: The “indication of price of the goods” under this Article refers to the price and price unit or symbols commonly used in the relevant transaction.

9. **Indication of Production, Processing, or Use Method**: The “indication of production, processing, or use method of the goods” under this Article refers to a direct indication of the production, processing, or use methods of the designated goods.

10. **Indication of Timing**: The “indication of timing of the goods” under this Article refers to a direct indication of the season, time period, or specific time when the designated goods are to be sold or used.

11. **Titles of Books and Periodicals**: Titles of books and periodicals that directly indicate the contents of such publications fall under the quality indication specified in this Article. This also applies to titles of recorded tapes, disks, CDs, and films containing recorded content.

12. **Method of Using Indications**: This Article applies only to “marks presented in a generally used manner.” Therefore, marks that are displayed in a distinctive manner or combined with other distinguishable elements that clearly identify the goods are not subject to this Article. However, even if a mark is used in a special manner, if it is so stylized that a general person, without particular attention, cannot directly associate it with descriptive or informative content, or if the combined elements are secondary or merely supplementary, it may still be perceived as a quality-indicative mark.

13. **Combination of Quality-Indicating Marks**: The Article applies to combined marks that include quality-indicating marks specified in Paragraphs 1 to 10.

14. **Misleading or Deceptive Representation**: If a mark that falls under this Article may also mislead consumers about the quality of the goods or deceive consumers, Article 7, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 11 shall also apply.

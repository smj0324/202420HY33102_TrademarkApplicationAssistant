# Project Overview
The problem with assessing originality, similarity, and distinctiveness during the trademark application process is that it relies on the examiner's subjectivity.
We developed a system that proactively predicts the likelihood of success of trademark applications and provides feedback to users.
We aimed to develop a system that could efficiently analyse trademark data for trademark applications and automatically predict whether an application will be registered based on AI.

# Project Description

The project begins by first analyzing **similar trademarks**, **applicants**, and **classification-similarity groups** to make initial judgments. Based on this initial analysis, detailed exception handling is conducted as the next step.

Even in cases where an application would typically fail during these processes, approval may still occur depending on the examiner's discretion and flexibility. Therefore, the system does not immediately issue a "rejection" decision. Instead, it is designed to forward the necessary information at the end of the process, enabling final judgment to be made with all relevant factors considered.

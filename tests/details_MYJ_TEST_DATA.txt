Predict Registration Status: The trademark "에스테틱 ESTHETIC" faces significant challenges due to its potential descriptiveness and the commonality of the term "aesthetic" in the beauty and wellness industry.

Predict Registration Status: The trademark "Flying Boat" is likely to be considered descriptive as it directly describes a type of vehicle that combines features of both an aircraft and a boat.

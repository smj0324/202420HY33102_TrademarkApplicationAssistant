The trademark "한국정품인증" presents a complex case for registration. On one hand, it has the potential to be seen as distinctive due to its suggestive nature, implying a certification of authenticity for Korean products. This could allow it to be classified as a suggestive mark, which may be eligible for registration if it has acquired distinctiveness through use. However, the descriptive elements of the trademark, particularly "정품" (genuine product) and "인증" (certification), raise significant concerns. These terms directly describe the quality and nature of the goods, which could lead to a rejection under the Trademark Examination Guidelines. If the mark is commonly used in the industry, it may also be classified as a common mark, further complicating its eligibility. Therefore, while there are arguments for approval based on distinctiveness and suggestiveness, the strong descriptive nature of the trademark and potential common usage suggest a higher likelihood of rejection.

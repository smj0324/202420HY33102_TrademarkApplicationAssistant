The trademark "예지미인 데일리 코튼" is eligible for approval as it includes a unique and potentially distinctive component, "예지미인," which does not appear to be a common term in the industry. This uniqueness, combined with the suggestive nature of the trademark, supports its registration. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the likelihood of distinctiveness and brand identity. While there are challenges regarding the common and descriptive elements of "데일리" and "코튼," the overall combination and the applicant's prior registration provide sufficient grounds for approval.

The trademark "포모나" is distinctive and does not appear to be a common name for the goods or services it represents. It is likely a fanciful mark, which inherently qualifies for registration without needing to demonstrate acquired distinctiveness.

The absence of common usage and descriptive implications further supports its eligibility for trademark registration.
** The trademark "메이크케어" demonstrates a unique combination of terms that contributes to its distinctiveness, as it does not solely consist of common names for goods in the beauty and personal care industry. While "케어" (care) is a widely used term, the combination with "메이크" (make) creates a phrase that is not commonly used in the trade society, enhancing its potential for brand recognition.

Given that there is a finding of a similar trademark already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, as per the guidelines.
The trademark "래쉬픽" demonstrates distinctiveness as it appears to be a coined term that does not directly describe the goods or services it represents. It is not commonly used in the trade, which supports its eligibility for registration. Additionally, if it is presented in a unique manner, this further enhances its distinctiveness. Since there is no indication of a similar trademark registered by the same applicant, the application should be approved without exception.

The trademark "한국정품인증" faces significant challenges to its eligibility for registration due to its descriptive nature and potential commonality in the industry. While it may suggest a certification of authenticity for Korean products, the term "정품인증" directly describes the nature of the services provided, which could lead to a determination that it lacks distinctiveness. Additionally, if this term is widely recognized and used by competitors in the industry, it may be classified as a common mark, further supporting the rejection under the Trademark Examination Guidelines. The potential for confusion with existing trademarks also raises concerns about its registrability.
The trademark "천연성분 편백나무 향이 그대로- 주식회사 피톤치드 수" is eligible for approval due to the presence of a similar trademark already registered by the same applicant, which mandates approval without exception. Additionally, while the trademark contains descriptive elements, the inclusion of the company name "주식회사 피톤치드 수" enhances its distinctiveness and indicates the source of the goods. This combination may allow the trademark to be perceived as distinctive enough to qualify for registration, despite the descriptive nature of certain components.
The trademark "예지미인 데일리 코튼" faces significant challenges due to the descriptive nature of "데일리 코튼," which directly indicates the characteristics of the goods as cotton items intended for daily use. This descriptive aspect renders the mark non-distinctive under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Law. While "예지미인" may provide some level of distinctiveness, it is not sufficient to overcome the common name issue associated with "데일리 코튼." Without evidence of acquired distinctiveness through extensive use in the market, the overall mark does not meet the requirements for trademark registration.

While "예지미인" may suggest a unique brand identity, it does not sufficiently overcome the descriptive nature of the overall trademark. Without evidence of acquired distinctiveness or a unique presentation that differentiates it from common terms in the industry, the application is likely to be rejected.

The trademark "포모나" can be approved for registration as it is likely to be perceived as a fanciful mark, which is inherently distinctive and does not describe the goods or services it represents.

The trademark "메이크케어" may be rejected due to its potential classification as a descriptive mark under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Law. The term "케어" (care) is commonly used in the beauty and personal care industry, which could lead to the interpretation of "메이크케어" as a generic term for related products or services. While there are arguments for its distinctiveness, particularly if it has been stylized or has acquired distinctiveness through extensive use, the prevailing concern is that it may not sufficiently differentiate itself from common industry terminology. Therefore, without compelling evidence of distinctiveness or unique branding, the application is likely to face rejection.

While there are concerns regarding its potential common usage and descriptive nature, the evidence suggests that it does not directly describe the goods or services it may be associated with.

Given that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, as per the guidelines.
** The trademark "패티온" is likely to be approved for registration due to the findings from the examination results. Specifically, if it is determined that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant (as indicated in Result for Code 1), the application must be approved without exception. Additionally, "패티온" has the potential to be classified as a fanciful mark, which is inherently distinctive and does not require proof of acquired distinctiveness. This unique nature, combined with the possibility of it being used in a manner that distinguishes it from common names, supports its eligibility for trademark protection. However, it is essential to ensure that "패티온" does not conflict with any existing trademarks or is not perceived as a common name in the relevant market. Overall, the distinctiveness and potential prior registration by the same applicant favor approval.
The trademark "좋은 집 좋은 자재" is primarily descriptive, as it directly refers to the quality and nature of the goods (construction materials and housing). It lacks the distinctiveness required for trademark protection under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Law. Although there is potential for acquired distinctiveness, the applicant must provide substantial evidence of recognition in the marketplace, which has not been established in the examination results. Additionally, the phrase does not present unique stylization or elements that would differentiate it from common industry terms, further supporting the rejection.
The trademark "엑토인" is likely to be approved for registration as it appears to be a fanciful mark that does not directly describe the goods or services it represents. It is inherently distinctive and does not have a known meaning in Korean, which supports its eligibility for trademark protection. Additionally, if there is a finding that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the likelihood of approval. However, it is essential to ensure that "엑토인" does not resemble any existing trademarks or common terms in the relevant market to maintain its distinctiveness.
The trademark "한국정품인증" is likely to be rejected due to its descriptive nature, as it directly describes the certification of authenticity for products, particularly Korean goods. The term "정품인증" (genuine product certification) is commonly used in trade, which diminishes its distinctiveness and may lead to consumer perception as a common name rather than a unique source identifier. Additionally, the geographical term "한국" (Korean) further emphasizes its descriptive character, indicating the origin of the goods. While there is potential for approval if the applicant can demonstrate acquired distinctiveness or unique stylization, the current examination results suggest that it does not meet the distinctiveness requirement necessary for registration.
The trademark "천연성분 편백나무 향이 그대로- 주식회사 피톤치드 수" is likely to be rejected due to its descriptive nature. The terms "천연성분" (natural ingredients) and "편백나무 향" (cypress scent) directly describe the characteristics of the goods, which may lead to a determination that the mark lacks the distinctiveness required for registration. While there is a possibility for approval if the applicant can demonstrate acquired distinctiveness or unique presentation, the current examination results indicate that the mark primarily serves a descriptive function, making it non-registrable under the relevant trademark laws.

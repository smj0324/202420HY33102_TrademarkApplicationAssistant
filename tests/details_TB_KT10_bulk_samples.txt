Input Brand: 모두웰
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "모두웰" demonstrates distinctiveness and does not appear to be descriptive of the goods or services it represents. The examination results indicate that it does not consist solely of common names or terms widely recognized in the industry, which supports its eligibility for registration. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the decision to grant trademark protection. Careful consideration of existing trademarks and common usage will further ensure that "모두웰" does not create confusion in the marketplace.
========================================
Input Brand: 한의원 무본자강 무본자강
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "한의원 무본자강 무본자강" is eligible for approval due to its potential distinctiveness and non-descriptive nature. The repetition of "무본자강" may enhance its uniqueness, allowing it to stand out in the marketplace. Additionally, if it can be established that "무본자강" does not directly describe the services offered by the 한의원 and is not commonly used in the industry, it supports the argument for registration. Furthermore, since a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the likelihood of consumer association with the applicant's brand.
========================================
Input Brand: 버드리
Registration Status: Reject
Reason: The trademark "버드리" does not meet the distinctiveness requirement necessary for registration. Although it is not registered by the same applicant and has potential for brand recognition, there are concerns regarding its common name usage and possible descriptive nature within the relevant market. If "버드리" is recognized as a common term or if it describes the goods in a way that consumers would understand, it may be rejected under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Item 3. Additionally, the risk of confusion with existing similar trademarks further complicates its eligibility, necessitating a thorough examination of its use and recognition in commerce.
========================================
Input Brand: 다함께 차차차
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "다함께 차차차" has a highly similar registered trademark with the same name under different applicants, which allows for temporary approval. Additionally, the trademark demonstrates distinctiveness and non-descriptive qualities, making it eligible for registration. While there are concerns regarding common usage and potential confusion, the unique combination of words and its suggestive nature contribute positively to its registration potential. Therefore, given the existing similar trademark by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception.
========================================
Input Brand: 하프밀
Registration Status: **Reject**
Reason: The trademark "하프밀" presents potential issues regarding its distinctiveness and descriptiveness. While it may initially appear to be distinctive and suggestive, there are significant concerns that it could be interpreted as descriptive of a type of meal that is "half" in size or quantity. If "하프밀" is commonly used within the food industry to refer to a specific type of meal, it may be classified as a common name, which would render it ineligible for registration under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1. Additionally, the risk of confusion with existing trademarks that are similar in sound or meaning could further complicate its registration, as outlined in Article 7, Paragraph 1, Item 11. Therefore, without clear evidence of distinctiveness and consumer recognition, the application for "하프밀" should be rejected.
========================================
Input Brand: 히비초
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "히비초" demonstrates a strong potential for registration due to its distinctiveness and non-descriptive nature. The examination results indicate that it is a coined term that does not directly describe any specific goods or services, aligning with the guidelines for inherently distinctive marks. Additionally, if the examination for Code 1 confirms that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception. However, it is crucial to conduct further research to ensure that "히비초" is not commonly used within the relevant industry and to verify the absence of any existing similar trademarks that could lead to consumer confusion. Overall, the unique character of "히비초" supports its eligibility for trademark registration.
========================================
Input Brand: 별미당 별미당
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "별미당 별미당" is eligible for approval due to the finding in Result for Code 1, which indicates that a highly similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant. According to the guidelines, if a similar trademark is registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding distinctiveness and potential descriptiveness, the unique repetition of the term and its potential recognition among consumers may support its distinctiveness. However, the primary reason for approval is the existing registration by the same applicant, which necessitates the approval of this application.
========================================
Input Brand: 살박사은좌
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "살박사은좌" demonstrates distinctiveness and does not appear to be descriptive or commonly used within the relevant market. The examination results indicate that it is a coined term that does not directly describe the goods or services it may represent, thus aligning with the requirements for trademark registration. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the decision to grant registration. A thorough review of its usage and recognition in the market supports its eligibility, as it does not violate any prohibitions outlined in the Trademark Examination Guidelines.
========================================
Input Brand: 통일한의원
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The examination results indicate that the trademark "통일한의원" possesses a level of distinctiveness due to the unique combination of the terms "통일" (Unified) and "한의원" (Oriental Medicine Clinic). While "한의원" is a common term in the industry, the prefix "통일" adds a distinctive element that could differentiate it from other clinics. Furthermore, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, as indicated in Result for Code 1, this application must be approved without exception. The potential for confusion exists due to the commonality of "한의원," but the unique aspect of "통일" may mitigate this risk, supporting the argument for registration. Overall, the distinctiveness provided by the combination of terms and the existing registration by the same applicant justify the approval of the trademark.
========================================
Input Brand: 태양점보히터
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "태양점보히터" demonstrates a unique combination of terms that enhances its distinctiveness, particularly due to the non-descriptive nature of "태양" (sun) and "점보" (jumbo). While the inclusion of "히터" (heater) is a common term, the overall phrase does not solely consist of generic names and suggests a specific branding that could imply a larger or more powerful heater. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the likelihood of registration. The potential for confusion is mitigated by the unique branding, which may allow it to serve as a source identifier for the goods.
========================================
Input Brand: 문영월
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "문영월" is eligible for registration as it demonstrates distinctiveness and does not appear to be a common or descriptive term in the relevant market. The examination results indicate that it is not widely recognized as a common name for goods or services, and if it is used in a manner that consumers can associate it with a specific source, it fulfills the requirements for trademark protection. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the decision to grant registration.
========================================
Input Brand: 칼로바이 프로틴 에이드
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "칼로바이 프로틴 에이드" (Calobye Protein Aid) demonstrates a level of distinctiveness primarily due to the coined term "칼로바이" (Calobye), which does not directly describe the goods and suggests a unique brand identity. While the terms "프로틴" (protein) and "에이드" (aid) may be viewed as descriptive, the overall combination of the trademark leans towards being suggestive rather than purely descriptive. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the likelihood of registration. The unique branding elements and suggestive nature of the trademark contribute to its potential for approval under the Trademark Examination Guidelines.
========================================
Input Brand: 무스웰 미니컵
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "무스웰 미니컵" is eligible for registration due to the presence of a similar trademark already registered by the same applicant, as indicated in Result for Code 1. This finding necessitates approval without exception. Additionally, while the term "미니컵" is descriptive, the unique and suggestive nature of "무스웰" contributes to the overall distinctiveness of the trademark. The combination of these elements creates a unique identifier that can help consumers associate the product with the applicant, further supporting the case for registration.
========================================
Input Brand: 당신의 피부혈액형은 무엇입니까?
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "당신의 피부혈액형은 무엇입니까?" demonstrates a unique and distinctive nature that sets it apart from common descriptive terms in the industry. Although there are concerns regarding its potentially descriptive interpretation, the phrase's unique formulation as a question contributes to its distinctiveness, allowing it to evoke curiosity and engagement among consumers. Additionally, if the trademark is already registered by the same applicant, it must be approved without exception, reinforcing its eligibility for registration. The combination of its suggestive quality and potential for acquired distinctiveness further supports the conclusion that it can serve as a source identifier for the goods or services offered.
========================================
Input Brand: 나티커
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "나티커" is likely to be approved for registration due to its distinctiveness as a coined term that does not have a known meaning in the Korean language. It appears to be a fanciful mark, which is inherently distinctive and does not require proof of acquired distinctiveness. Additionally, if there are no similar trademarks registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception. The examination results indicate that "나티커" does not describe the goods or services it represents, and there is no evidence of common usage that would disqualify it under trademark law. Therefore, based on the positive aspects of distinctiveness and uniqueness, "나티커" has a strong potential for approval.
========================================
Input Brand: 살 빼주는 언니
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "살 빼주는 언니" has been found to possess distinctiveness due to its unique expression and potential suggestive nature regarding weight loss services. Although it is inherently descriptive, it does not appear to be commonly used in the industry, which supports its eligibility for registration. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the decision to grant trademark status.
========================================
Input Brand: 어른이놀이터
Registration Status: Reject
Reason: While "어른이놀이터" demonstrates potential distinctiveness and consumer recognition, it faces significant challenges regarding its commonality and descriptive nature within the relevant industry. The term may be perceived as a common name for adult recreational spaces, which could lead to confusion among consumers and hinder its eligibility for trademark registration. Additionally, if it is widely recognized as a standard term in the market, it may not serve as a distinctive identifier of the source of the services, thus failing to meet the requirements outlined in the Trademark Examination Guidelines.
========================================
Input Brand: 현자의 돌 생활과 윤리
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "현자의 돌 생활과 윤리" demonstrates a level of distinctiveness that aligns with the criteria for trademark registration. The examination results indicate that the trademark is not merely descriptive of the goods or services it represents, but rather suggests a deeper philosophical and ethical connotation. This suggestive nature enhances its potential as a unique brand identifier. Furthermore, since the examination for Code 1 reveals that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception. The combination of these factors supports the conclusion that the trademark can function effectively as a source identifier in the marketplace, despite some concerns regarding potential common name classification and confusion with existing trademarks.
========================================
Input Brand: 대성자동문
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "대성자동문" is eligible for registration as it combines distinctive elements that suggest a specific brand identity rather than merely describing the goods. The presence of "대성" as a potential proper name enhances its distinctiveness, while the combination with "자동문" does not solely indicate the nature of the goods. Additionally, if the trademark has been used in commerce and has gained recognition among consumers, it further supports its distinctiveness. Since a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, aligning with the guidelines for trademark registration.
========================================
Input Brand: 아마존펫
Registration Status: ** Reject
Reason: ** The trademark "아마존펫" presents significant challenges for registration primarily due to its potential for consumer confusion with the well-known brand "Amazon." While the combination of "아마존" (Amazon) and "펫" (Pet) may suggest a thematic association with pet-related products, the use of a globally recognized brand name raises concerns about the likelihood of confusion among consumers regarding the source of the goods or services. This confusion could dilute the distinctiveness of the Amazon brand and violate trademark regulations that prohibit registration of marks that could mislead consumers. Additionally, the term "펫" is common in the industry, which further complicates the distinctiveness of the mark. Therefore, despite some positive aspects, the risks associated with consumer confusion and the commonality of the term lead to a recommendation for rejection.
========================================
Input Brand: 모두웰
Registration Status: The trademark "모두웰" faces significant challenges due to its potential classification as a common name and descriptive term in the health and wellness industry. The term "모두" (meaning "all") and "웰" (derived from "well") may be perceived as generic descriptors, which could lead to rejection under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 for consisting solely of common names, and under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 3 for being descriptive of the goods' quality or purpose. Although there are avenues for establishing distinctiveness through unique presentation or acquired secondary meaning, the current examination results indicate that the mark does not sufficiently meet the distinctiveness requirements necessary for trademark registration. Additionally, the risk of confusion with existing similar trademarks further complicates the registration process.

Input Brand: 한의원 무본자강 무본자강
Registration Status: The trademark "한의원 무본자강 무본자강" is likely to be rejected due to its descriptive nature. The term "한의원" (Oriental Medicine Clinic) is a common term in the industry, which undermines the distinctiveness required for trademark registration. Additionally, while "무본자강" may have potential for uniqueness, its repetition does not sufficiently differentiate the mark from common terms. Without evidence of acquired distinctiveness through extensive use, the trademark fails to meet the necessary criteria for registration under the Trademark Examination Guidelines.

Input Brand: 버드리
Registration Status: The trademark "버드리" may face rejection due to its potential classification as a common name for the relevant goods, as indicated in Result for Code 1. If it is determined that "버드리" is widely recognized as a generic term within the trade, it would not meet the distinctiveness requirement necessary for trademark registration. Additionally, while it may be considered a fanciful mark under Result for Code 2, any similarity to existing trademarks or common terms could lead to rejection under Article 34 Paragraph 1 Item 7. Therefore, the lack of distinctiveness and potential confusion with existing marks support a rejection of the application.

Registration Status: The trademark "다함께 차차차" faces significant challenges regarding its distinctiveness. The examination results indicate that it may be perceived as a common name or descriptive phrase within the relevant market, particularly in the context of dance or entertainment services. This perception could lead to a rejection under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1, which prohibits trademarks that consist solely of common names. Additionally, while there is a possibility for approval if the applicant can demonstrate acquired distinctiveness, the risk of it being classified as a common phrase or slogan remains high. Therefore, without sufficient evidence to support its uniqueness or distinctiveness, the application is likely to be rejected.

This interpretation aligns with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Law, which prohibits trademarks that lack distinctiveness. While there are arguments for potential distinctiveness through stylization or acquired recognition, the primary concern remains that the term could be widely recognized in the food industry as a descriptor for smaller meal sizes, thus failing to meet the necessary requirements for trademark registration.

Registration Status: The trademark "히비초" faces potential rejection primarily due to concerns regarding its distinctiveness. According to the examination results, there is a significant risk that "히비초" may be perceived as a common name within the relevant trade society, which would violate Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Trademark Law. If it is determined that the term is widely used to refer to specific goods, it would lack the necessary distinctiveness for trademark registration. Additionally, if "히비초" is found to be similar to existing trademarks, it could lead to consumer confusion, further supporting the rejection under Article 34, Paragraph 1, Item 7.

Input Brand: 별미당 별미당
Registration Status: The trademark "별미당 별미당" is likely to be rejected due to its reliance on the common term "별미," which translates to "delicacy" or "special dish." This term is widely recognized in the food service industry and may be deemed non-distinctive under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Law, as it does not uniquely identify the source of goods or services. The repetition of "별미당" does not enhance its distinctiveness, as it may be perceived merely as a stylistic choice.

Input Brand: 모두웰
Registration Status: The trademark "모두웰" faces significant challenges regarding its distinctiveness. While it has potential for uniqueness, the commonality of the term "모두" (all) in the Korean language raises concerns about it being perceived as a common name. Additionally, the term "웰" (well) may be interpreted as descriptive, suggesting qualities of the goods or services, which could further hinder its eligibility for registration. The potential for confusion with existing similar trademarks also poses a risk. Therefore, without clear evidence of acquired distinctiveness or a unique presentation that differentiates it from common usage, the application is likely to be rejected under the Trademark Examination Guidelines.

========================================
Input Brand: 하프밀
Registration Status: The trademark "하프밀" faces potential rejection primarily due to concerns regarding its distinctiveness. The term appears to be descriptive, as it directly conveys information about a type of meal (i.e., a meal that is half the usual portion). This descriptive nature could classify it under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Trademark Examination Guidelines, which prohibits the registration of descriptive marks unless they have acquired distinctiveness through extensive use. Additionally, if "하프" (meaning "half") and "밀" (meaning "meal") are commonly used terms in the relevant market, this further supports the argument for rejection based on non-distinctiveness. Without evidence of acquired distinctiveness or a unique presentation that sets it apart from common usage, "하프밀" is unlikely to meet the requirements for trademark registration.

Input Brand: 문영월
Registration Status: The trademark "문영월" faces potential rejection primarily due to concerns regarding its distinctiveness. The examination results indicate that if "문영월" is recognized as a common name or descriptive term within the relevant market, it would not meet the distinctiveness requirement necessary for trademark registration. Additionally, if it is perceived as merely descriptive of the goods or services it represents, it would fall under the categories of common marks or descriptive marks, leading to ineligibility for registration. While there is a possibility for the trademark to acquire distinctiveness through extensive use, the current examination does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. Therefore, without clear evidence of distinctiveness or uniqueness, the application for "문영월" should be rejected.

Input Brand: 당신의 피부혈액형은 무엇입니까?
Registration Status: The trademark "당신의 피부혈액형은 무엇입니까?" is likely to be rejected due to its descriptive nature, as it directly refers to a concept related to skin and blood type, which could be interpreted as describing goods or services in the skincare or health assessment industry.

Input Brand: 모두웰
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "모두웰" demonstrates a level of distinctiveness that aligns with the criteria for registration. The examination results indicate that it does not consist solely of common or descriptive terms, and its unique combination of elements suggests it could serve as a source identifier for the goods or services it represents. Additionally, if there is a finding that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the likelihood of its acceptance. While there are concerns regarding its common components and potential confusion with existing trademarks, the overall assessment leans towards approval based on its unique character and the absence of direct descriptiveness.
========================================
Input Brand: 통일한의원
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "통일한의원" possesses a unique combination of the term "통일" (Unification) with the common term "한의원" (Oriental Medicine Clinic), which enhances its distinctiveness. Although "한의원" is widely used in the industry, the prefix "통일" adds a distinctive element that suggests a specific theme or philosophy, potentially allowing it to be perceived as a suggestive mark. Furthermore, if the applicant has previously registered similar trademarks, this application must be approved without exception, as per the examination guidelines. The potential for consumer recognition and the non-descriptive nature of "통일" further support the eligibility for registration, outweighing the challenges posed by the commonality of "한의원."
========================================
Input Brand: 한의원 무본자강 무본자강
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The examination results indicate that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, which mandates approval of this application without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding the common name usage of "한의원" and the potential descriptiveness of "무본자강," the unique presentation and repetition of "무본자강" may contribute to its distinctiveness. Given that the applicant already holds a similar trademark, this application should be approved based on the established precedent.
========================================
Input Brand: 다함께 차차차
Registration Status: approve
Reason: The trademark "다함께 차차차" is eligible for approval due to the existence of a highly similar trademark already registered by the same applicant, which necessitates its acceptance without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding its distinctiveness and potential descriptiveness, the unique composition of the trademark and its suggestive nature contribute to its overall potential for registration. The context in which it is used, emphasizing togetherness and cultural expression, further supports its distinctiveness, making it a suitable candidate for trademark registration.
========================================
Input Brand: 하프밀
Registration Status: reject
Reason: While "하프밀" has potential for distinctiveness and may be considered suggestive, there are significant concerns regarding its descriptiveness and common usage in the food industry. The term could be interpreted as directly indicating a type of meal, which may classify it as descriptive and non-distinctive. Additionally, if it is commonly used to refer to smaller meal portions, it may have lost its distinctiveness, leading to a risk of confusion with existing trademarks. A thorough examination of its use in the relevant market is necessary to determine its eligibility for trademark registration.
========================================
Input Brand: 별미당 별미당
Registration Status: approve
Reason: The trademark "별미당 별미당" is highly similar to an already registered trademark by the same applicant, which necessitates approval of this application without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding the distinctiveness of the term "별미당," the repetition of the term may create a unique branding identity that could differentiate it from other trademarks in the market. The potential for distinctiveness, combined with the existing registration by the same applicant, supports the decision to approve the trademark.
========================================
Input Brand: 태양점보히터
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "태양점보히터" (Sun Jumbo Heater) should be approved for registration due to the finding in Result for Code 1, which indicates that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant. This finding necessitates approval without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding the descriptive nature of "점보히터" (Jumbo Heater), the unique combination with "태양" (Sun) contributes to a level of distinctiveness that may satisfy the requirements for registration. The potential for confusion with existing trademarks is mitigated by the applicant's prior registration, further supporting the decision to approve the trademark.
========================================
Input Brand: 칼로바이 프로틴 에이드
Registration Status: Approve
Reason: The trademark "칼로바이 프로틴 에이드" (Calobye Protein Aid) demonstrates a unique and distinctive element through the coined term "칼로바이," which sets it apart from common industry terminology. Although the terms "프로틴" (protein) and "에이드" (aid) are recognized in the market, the overall combination does not solely describe the goods and suggests a functional aspect without being purely descriptive. Given that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the distinctiveness of the brand in the marketplace.
========================================
Input Brand: 무스웰 미니컵
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "무스웰 미니컵" is eligible for registration due to the presence of the unique and distinctive term "무스웰," which differentiates it from other products in the market. Although "미니컵" is descriptive of the product type, the combination with "무스웰" creates a unique brand identity that is not commonly used, fulfilling the distinctiveness requirement. Additionally, since a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, as per the guidelines.
========================================
Input Brand: 당신의 피부혈액형은 무엇입니까?
Registration Status: Reject
Reason: The trademark "당신의 피부혈액형은 무엇입니까?" faces significant challenges due to its potentially descriptive nature. While it has unique phrasing that could suggest distinctiveness, the phrase may be interpreted as directly relating to characteristics of products or services in the skincare or health industry. This could classify it as a descriptive mark, which is generally non-registrable unless it has acquired distinctiveness through extensive use. Additionally, if the term "skin blood type" is recognized as a common term within the industry, it may further hinder its eligibility for trademark registration under the relevant trademark examination standards.
========================================
Input Brand: 살 빼주는 언니
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "살 빼주는 언니" demonstrates sufficient distinctiveness due to its unique phrasing and personal touch, which sets it apart from common descriptive terms in the weight loss industry. Although there are concerns regarding its potential descriptiveness, the phrase suggests a supportive relationship rather than merely describing the service. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the argument for its registration.
========================================
Input Brand: 대성자동문
Registration Status: ** Approve
Reason: ** The trademark "대성자동문" is eligible for registration as it demonstrates a level of distinctiveness that outweighs its descriptive elements. The term "대성" serves as a proper noun, which contributes to the uniqueness of the mark, while "자동문" (automatic door) is a descriptive term. However, the combination creates a unique impression that is not merely descriptive of the goods. Additionally, if the applicant has previously registered similar trademarks, this application must be approved without exception, as per the guidelines. The potential for the mark to have gained recognition among consumers as a source identifier further supports its registration. Therefore, despite the descriptive nature of "자동문," the overall distinctiveness and the applicant's prior registrations justify approval.

The trademark "모두웰" faces significant challenges due to its potential classification as a common name and descriptive term in the health and wellness industry. The term "모두" (meaning "all") and "웰" (derived from "well") may be perceived as generic descriptors, which could lead to rejection under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 for consisting solely of common names, and under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 3 for being descriptive of the goods' quality or purpose. Although there are avenues for establishing distinctiveness through unique presentation or acquired secondary meaning, the current examination results indicate that the mark does not sufficiently meet the distinctiveness requirements necessary for trademark registration. Additionally, the risk of confusion with existing similar trademarks further complicates the registration process.
The trademark "한의원 무본자강 무본자강" is likely to be rejected due to its descriptive nature. The term "한의원" (Oriental Medicine Clinic) is a common term in the industry, which undermines the distinctiveness required for trademark registration. Additionally, while "무본자강" may have potential for uniqueness, its repetition does not sufficiently differentiate the mark from common terms. Without evidence of acquired distinctiveness through extensive use, the trademark fails to meet the necessary criteria for registration under the Trademark Examination Guidelines.
The trademark "버드리" may face rejection due to its potential classification as a common name for the relevant goods, as indicated in Result for Code 1. If it is determined that "버드리" is widely recognized as a generic term within the trade, it would not meet the distinctiveness requirement necessary for trademark registration. Additionally, while it may be considered a fanciful mark under Result for Code 2, any similarity to existing trademarks or common terms could lead to rejection under Article 34 Paragraph 1 Item 7. Therefore, the lack of distinctiveness and potential confusion with existing marks support a rejection of the application.
The trademark "다함께 차차차" faces significant challenges regarding its distinctiveness. The examination results indicate that it may be perceived as a common name or descriptive phrase within the relevant market, particularly in the context of dance or entertainment services. This perception could lead to a rejection under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1, which prohibits trademarks that consist solely of common names. Additionally, while there is a possibility for approval if the applicant can demonstrate acquired distinctiveness, the risk of it being classified as a common phrase or slogan remains high. Therefore, without sufficient evidence to support its uniqueness or distinctiveness, the application is likely to be rejected.
The trademark "하프밀" is likely to be rejected due to its descriptive nature, as it may be interpreted as a common name for a specific type of meal or food portion. This interpretation aligns with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Law, which prohibits trademarks that lack distinctiveness. While there are arguments for potential distinctiveness through stylization or acquired recognition, the primary concern remains that the term could be widely recognized in the food industry as a descriptor for smaller meal sizes, thus failing to meet the necessary requirements for trademark registration.
The trademark "히비초" faces potential rejection primarily due to concerns regarding its distinctiveness. According to the examination results, there is a significant risk that "히비초" may be perceived as a common name within the relevant trade society, which would violate Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Trademark Law. If it is determined that the term is widely used to refer to specific goods, it would lack the necessary distinctiveness for trademark registration. Additionally, if "히비초" is found to be similar to existing trademarks, it could lead to consumer confusion, further supporting the rejection under Article 34, Paragraph 1, Item 7. While there are arguments for its uniqueness as a fanciful mark, the potential for it being classified as a common term or being similar to existing marks outweighs the positive aspects, leading to the conclusion that it should be rejected.
The trademark "별미당 별미당" is likely to be rejected due to its reliance on the common term "별미," which translates to "delicacy" or "special dish." This term is widely recognized in the food service industry and may be deemed non-distinctive under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Law, as it does not uniquely identify the source of goods or services. The repetition of "별미당" does not enhance its distinctiveness, as it may be perceived merely as a stylistic choice. Without evidence of unique usage or acquired distinctiveness, the trademark fails to meet the necessary criteria for registration.
The trademark "살박사은좌" may face rejection due to its potential classification as a common name or descriptive term within the relevant trade society, which would violate Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Item 3 of the Law. If it is recognized as a term commonly used to describe specific goods or services, it lacks the distinctiveness required for trademark registration. Additionally, there is a risk of confusion with existing trademarks, which could further support a rejection under Article 34, Paragraph 1, Item 9. Despite some positive aspects regarding its uniqueness, the overall examination results indicate significant concerns regarding its distinctiveness and potential for confusion in the marketplace.
The trademark "모두웰" faces significant challenges regarding its distinctiveness. While it has potential for uniqueness, the commonality of the term "모두" (all) in the Korean language raises concerns about it being perceived as a common name. Additionally, the term "웰" (well) may be interpreted as descriptive, suggesting qualities of the goods or services, which could further hinder its eligibility for registration. The potential for confusion with existing similar trademarks also poses a risk. Therefore, without clear evidence of acquired distinctiveness or a unique presentation that differentiates it from common usage, the application is likely to be rejected under the Trademark Examination Guidelines.
The trademark "한의원 무본자강 무본자강" must be approved as a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, which mandates approval without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding distinctiveness and potential descriptiveness, the applicant may have established a level of recognition in the market that could support the claim of acquired distinctiveness. Therefore, given the existing registration by the same applicant, the application should be approved.
The trademark "버드리" is eligible for registration due to its distinctiveness and non-descriptive nature. If it is not recognized as a common name within the relevant trade society and does not directly describe the goods or services it represents, it can be classified as a suggestive or arbitrary mark. Additionally, if the applicant has previously registered similar trademarks, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the distinctiveness of "버드리" as a source identifier in the market.
The examination results indicate that "다함께 차차차" is a unique phrase that does not solely consist of common names for goods or services, contributing to its distinctiveness. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception. While there are concerns regarding its potential descriptiveness and common usage in cultural contexts, the applicant may demonstrate acquired distinctiveness through extensive use, further supporting its eligibility for registration. Therefore, based on the guidelines and the specific circumstances, the trademark should be approved.
The trademark "하프밀" faces potential rejection primarily due to concerns regarding its distinctiveness. The term appears to be descriptive, as it directly conveys information about a type of meal (i.e., a meal that is half the usual portion). This descriptive nature could classify it under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Trademark Examination Guidelines, which prohibits the registration of descriptive marks unless they have acquired distinctiveness through extensive use. Additionally, if "하프" (meaning "half") and "밀" (meaning "meal") are commonly used terms in the relevant market, this further supports the argument for rejection based on non-distinctiveness. Without evidence of acquired distinctiveness or a unique presentation that sets it apart from common usage, "하프밀" is unlikely to meet the requirements for trademark registration.
The trademark "히비초" is likely to be approved for registration due to its distinctiveness as a coined term that does not directly describe the goods or services it represents. The examination results indicate that if "히비초" is not commonly used in the trade society and is presented in a unique manner, it can be classified as distinctive. Additionally, if there are no existing similar trademarks registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, as per the guidelines. The potential for confusion with existing trademarks is mitigated by the uniqueness of the term, further supporting its eligibility for trademark protection.
The trademark "별미당 별미당" must be approved as there is a similar trademark already registered by the same applicant, which mandates approval without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding its distinctiveness and potential descriptiveness, the applicant can demonstrate that the mark has acquired distinctiveness through extensive use, which supports its eligibility for trademark registration. The unique repetition of "별미당" may also contribute to its distinctiveness, allowing it to stand out in the marketplace.
** The trademark "살박사은좌" is eligible for registration due to its distinctiveness and non-descriptive nature. The examination results indicate that it is a coined term that does not directly describe the goods or services, which supports its inherent distinctiveness. Additionally, if the applicant has previously registered similar trademarks, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the argument for its uniqueness in the marketplace. The potential for unique presentation further enhances its distinctiveness, making it a strong candidate for trademark registration.
The trademark "통일한의원" faces significant challenges for registration primarily due to its descriptive nature and the commonality of the term "한의원." While the prefix "통일" adds a distinctive element, it does not sufficiently elevate the overall distinctiveness of the mark, which is crucial for trademark registration. The term "한의원" is widely recognized in the industry, leading to potential confusion among consumers and failing to meet the distinctiveness requirements outlined in the Trademark Examination Guidelines. Additionally, unless the applicant can provide substantial evidence of acquired distinctiveness through extensive use in commerce, the mark is likely to be viewed as primarily descriptive and non-distinctive, resulting in a rejection.
The trademark "태양점보히터" must be approved as there is a similar trademark already registered by the same applicant, which satisfies the requirement for approval without exception. Additionally, while the trademark has descriptive elements, the unique combination of "태양" (Sun) and "점보히터" (Jumbo Heater) may still possess a level of distinctiveness. If the applicant can demonstrate that the mark has acquired distinctiveness through extensive use in the market, it further supports the case for registration.
The trademark "문영월" faces potential rejection primarily due to concerns regarding its distinctiveness. The examination results indicate that if "문영월" is recognized as a common name or descriptive term within the relevant market, it would not meet the distinctiveness requirement necessary for trademark registration. Additionally, if it is perceived as merely descriptive of the goods or services it represents, it would fall under the categories of common marks or descriptive marks, leading to ineligibility for registration. While there is a possibility for the trademark to acquire distinctiveness through extensive use, the current examination does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. Therefore, without clear evidence of distinctiveness or uniqueness, the application for "문영월" should be rejected.
The trademark "칼로바이 프로틴 에이드" should be approved due to the presence of a similar trademark already registered by the same applicant, as indicated in Result for Code 1. This aligns with the guidelines that mandate approval in such cases without exception. Additionally, while there are concerns regarding descriptiveness and commonality of terms, the unique element "칼로바이" may provide sufficient distinctiveness, especially if it has been recognized in the market. The applicant's established use of "칼로바이" can further support the trademark's eligibility for registration.
** The trademark "무스웰 미니컵" has a unique component, "무스웰," which provides a level of distinctiveness that can overcome the descriptiveness of "미니컵." Since the examination results indicate that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception. The distinctiveness of "무스웰" can be recognized by consumers as a source identifier, and if it has been used in commerce effectively, it supports the argument for registration. The combination of a distinctive term with a descriptive term does not solely consist of common names, allowing for the potential approval of the trademark.
The trademark "당신의 피부혈액형은 무엇입니까?" is likely to be rejected due to its descriptive nature, as it directly refers to a concept related to skin and blood type, which could be interpreted as describing goods or services in the skincare or health assessment industry. This aligns with Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Trademark Law, which states that trademarks that consist solely of marks indicating the nature or characteristics of the goods are not eligible for registration. Although there are unique elements that could support its registration, the potential for common usage in the relevant market and its direct descriptiveness present significant challenges to its eligibility. Additionally, without evidence of acquired distinctiveness through extensive use, the trademark does not function as a distinctive indicator of source.
** The trademark "나티커" demonstrates distinctiveness as it appears to be a coined term that does not directly describe the goods or services it represents. It does not fall under the prohibitions against descriptive trademarks and lacks common usage in the trade, suggesting it retains its source-identifying function. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, the application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the eligibility for registration. Further research into existing trademarks and consumer perception may be beneficial, but the current examination results support approval based on its unique and non-descriptive nature.
The trademark "살 빼주는 언니" should be approved as it demonstrates potential distinctiveness and uniqueness, particularly if the applicant can provide evidence of acquired distinctiveness through extensive use in the marketplace. While there are concerns regarding its descriptive nature, the personal and unique connotation of the phrase, along with the possibility of stylized presentation, supports its eligibility for trademark registration. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the argument for approval.
The trademark "어른이놀이터" has the potential for distinctiveness and consumer recognition, which can support its eligibility for registration. Although there are concerns regarding its descriptive nature and potential common usage in the industry, if the applicant can demonstrate that the mark has acquired distinctiveness through extensive use and consumer association, it may overcome these challenges. Additionally, since the examination results indicate that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, as per the guidelines.
The trademark "현자의 돌 생활과 윤리" is unique and does not consist solely of common names or descriptive terms related to specific goods or services. It has the potential for distinctiveness and unique branding, which aligns with the requirements for trademark registration. Additionally, if a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception, reinforcing the likelihood of its acceptance.
** The trademark "대성자동문" should be approved for registration as it meets the criteria outlined in the Trademark Examination Guidelines. Specifically, if the examination results for Code 1 indicate that a similar trademark is already registered by the same applicant, this application must be approved without exception. Furthermore, if "대성자동문" has acquired distinctiveness through extensive use in the market, it can be recognized as a source identifier for the applicant's goods, despite its potentially descriptive nature. The applicant may provide evidence of consumer recognition and unique presentation, which would further support its eligibility for trademark protection.
The trademark "아마존펫" faces significant challenges due to its potential descriptiveness and lack of distinctiveness. The term "아마존" is widely recognized as associated with the well-known e-commerce platform, which may lead to confusion regarding the source of the goods. Additionally, the common term "펫" contributes to the overall impression that the mark is merely descriptive of pet products, failing to serve as a unique source identifier. While there is potential for distinctiveness through extensive use, the current examination results do not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim, leading to a recommendation for rejection based on the Trademark Examination Guidelines.
